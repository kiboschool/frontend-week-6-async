# What to do?
Complete the file exercises.js with the following exercises.

**Syncronous-vs-asyncronous**
1. Create an asynchronous function that logs a message after a delay, and use it to see the order of execution in your code.

**Callbacks**
1. Create a function that accepts a callback. The function should return a string after 2 seconds using `setTimeout`.

**Async-await / Promises**
1. Fetch data from a public API using `fetch` (fetch uses promises under the hood) and console.log
2. Rewrite previous api call with `async/await`. Handle possible errors with `try/catch`.

**07-Browser-APIs**
1. Use the Geolocation API to get and log the current position (latitude and longitude).
2. Create a simple audio player with play and stop buttons using the Audio API. Try playing with different audio sources.
3. Use the Web Storage API to store some data in the user's browser and then retrieve it.
